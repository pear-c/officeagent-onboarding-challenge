### Common Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f app           # Follow app logs

# Execute commands in running container
docker compose exec app sh           # Shell into app
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres  # Connect to postgres

# Inspect
docker compose ps                     # Running services
docker compose top                    # Processes in each container
docker stats                          # Resource usage

# Rebuild
docker compose up --build             # Rebuild images
docker compose build --no-cache app   # Force full rebuild

# Clean up
docker compose down                   # Stop and remove containers
docker compose down -v                # Also remove volumes (DESTRUCTIVE)
