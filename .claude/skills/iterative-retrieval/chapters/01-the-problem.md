# The Problem

> 상위 스킬: [iterative-retrieval](../SKILL.md)

Subagents are spawned with limited context. They don't know:
- Which files contain relevant code
- What patterns exist in the codebase
- What terminology the project uses

Standard approaches fail:
- **Send everything**: Exceeds context limits
- **Send nothing**: Agent lacks critical information
- **Guess what's needed**: Often wrong
